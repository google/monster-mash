# Monster Mash: New Sketch-Based Modeling and Animation Tool

This is the open-source version of Monster Mash.

Monster Mash is a new sketch-based modeling and animation tool that allows you to quickly sketch a character, inflate it into 3D, and promptly animate it. You can perform all interactions in the sketching plane. No 3D manipulation is required.

The source code and web demo (http://MonsterMash.zone) accompanies a paper **Dvorožňák et al.: Monster Mash: A Single-View Approach to Casual 3D Modeling and Animation** published in ACM Transactions on Graphics 39(6):214 and presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2020 conference.
